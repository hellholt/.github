# 🔥 Hellholt 🔥

Hellholt is my homelab.  This is where, after a long day of beating my head against other people's infrastructure, I beat my head against my own.

## 🤩 Latest Stuff
- Got SSH certificates working!  Instead of yeeting pubkeys into `~/.ssh/authorized_keys`, the setup process now takes slightly longer because of all the slurping and signing!
- Cluster-wide Traefik reverse proxy with LetsEncrypt, instead of manually adding hosts and certs in HAProxy on my router/firewall.
- Refactored massively, since the old IaC was a nightmare.
- Added Bash command for more easily executing the Ansible roles where the 🪄magic🧙‍♂️ happens.

## 🍦 Cool Stuff
- Each host gets a MOTD of a coat of arms and colorful Bash prompt complete with appropriate emoji corresponding to their house.
