# üî• Hellholt üî•

Hellholt is my homelab.  This is where, after a long day of beating my head against other people's infrastructure, I beat my head against my own.

## ü§© Latest Stuff
- Got SSH certificates working!  Instead of yeeting pubkeys into `~/.ssh/authorized_keys`, the setup process now takes slightly longer because of all the slurping and signing!
- Cluster-wide Traefik reverse proxy with LetsEncrypt, instead of manually adding hosts and certs in HAProxy on my router/firewall.
- Per-host Traefik reverse proxy, rather than having to futz with the node ports.
- Refactored massively, since the old IaC was a nightmare.
- Added Bash command for more easily executing the Ansible roles where the ü™Ñmagicüßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è happens.
- Setup SyncTube for YouTube archiving.
- Setup Komga for Comics.
- Each host gets a MOTD of a coat of arms and colorful Bash prompt complete with appropriate emoji corresponding to their house.

## üë¥ Stuff I've Learned
- Yeah, hosting your blog on Kubernetes is a joke, but... really... Kubernetes is overkill and unnecessary complexity for a homelab and I wouldn't be bothering with it if it weren't for work.  Now learning this for a second time.
- Cert-Manager's pattern of using secrets to store certs introduces complexity for backup/restore I don't really want to bother with.  It's easier just to do TLS termination outside Kubernetes clusters with Traefik and persist generated certs in the filesystem.
- I never really need to SSH from one host to another; just from my local/control machine into one host or another.  The various mucking around I've done with SSH (first orchestrating SSH pub key circulation, and then SSH certificates) has been really unnecessary.  I just like the idea.
