# :fire: Hellholt :fire:

Hellholt is my homelab: a cluster of clusters, some of which contain other clusters, and probably some of those will contain clusters too if they don't already.

## ü§© Latest Stuff
- Got SSH certificates working!  Instead of yeeting pubkeys into `~/.ssh/authorized_keys`, the setup process now takes slightly longer because of all the slurping and signing!
- Cluster-wide Traefik reverse proxy with LetsEncrypt, instead of manually adding hosts and certs in HAProxy on my router/firewall.
- Refactored massively, since the old IaC was a nightmare.

## üç¶ Cool Stuff
- Each host gets a MOTD and colorful Bash prompt complete with appropriate emoji corresponding to their house.
